# arnold

Minimalist wrapper around the [SpeechSynthesis](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis) interface of the [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) to make your browser talk like Arnold. Or at least a lady like version of him. It's really not so similar. But it's fun. Enjoy!
